# (Neutron) CT-using-ASTRA-toolbox
Reconstruction of CT from a given set up projection images using projectors provided ASTRA toolbox.

Tomography reconstruction from a given set of projection images. Includes window-selection, pre-processing, sub-sampling (for exploration of sparse view effects). Three (mostly cited) algorithms: 1. FBP, 2. SIRT, and 3. TV (FISTA implementation). Choice of projector types (ASTRA toolbox: https://www.astra-toolbox.com/docs/algs/index.html#), beam geometry specifications, etc.
